Young, we were so young when we
thought that we know how to love
Fought about anything,
everything led to dysfunction
We just gotta own that shit,
don't let it go like this
And maybe we can grow from this, yeah
We both know I go too far,
like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when
he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out,
had to meet up at the park
Don't worry my love;
we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Caught we were caught up and the high
it was better than drugs
Too hard to see that it all would
lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own this shit
I hope we can grow from this
We both know I go too far,
like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father
when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out,
had to meet up at the park
Don't worry my love;
we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah yeah it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up
You tell me it's over
Say what you want
But it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up
You tell me it's over
Say what you want
But it's hard when you're young
We both know I go too far,
like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father
when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out,
had to meet up at the park
Don't worry my love; we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up
You tell me it's over
Say what you want
But it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up
You tell me it's over
You say what you want
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah it's hard when you're young
Yeah it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up
You tell me it's over
Say what you want
But it's hard when you're young
